# Survive!
A small game, made with Unity, as a part of my game dev learning process.

[My game on Unity Play](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-220310)

## Description
I made this game as a part of the "[Create with code 2](https://learn.unity.com/project/unit-4-gameplay-mechanics)" course on Unity Learn website.

I wrote the whole code by myself. I used the course's assets - models, particles, textures.

The focus in this game is about: enemy waves, powerups, and boss fights.

## Help me learn and improve
If you are an experienced Unity developer or C# developer, I would be very glad to recieve comments and review about my project and code. Help me learn :)
